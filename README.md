  - Web VR tools (A-Frame, Three.js)

## The Implementation

Have a VR view device next to the painting, we integrate interesting facts about the painting in a 360 timeline virtual view with voice over different background. Any Visitors can put it on to use it for modern, fun and richer museum experience.

Focusing on one art piece, organizing data alone the timeline, building a concept and process, so anyone who want to use above technologies can easily follow the steps for any art object for any museum.
