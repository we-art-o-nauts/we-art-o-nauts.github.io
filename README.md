## The Problem

As a museum visitor, I am interested in one special piece of artwork in the current exhibition. I would like to access more behind the painting information, right there in front of the actual painting.

## The Solution

Have a VR view device next to the painting, visitors can pick it up and put it on. The visitor will see the starting point, hear the information of the origin of the painting, then follow the timeline arrow to move the head right to 
- data
  * Research data done by art historians, provided by the museum, and crowdsourced (WikiData)
  * Contains dates, places, events, persons names, etc
- hardware
  * Gear VR oculus
- software
  * Data processing (Zepto, PapaParse)
  * Open data formats (CSV, Timeline.js)
  * Web VR tools (A-Frame, Three.js)
